## Fishface Tuna
Outputs from [Kaggle tuna fisheries competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/the-nature-conservancy-fisheries-monitoring) sponsored by The Nature Conservancy and Vulcan Technologies.  The goal of the competition was to create algorithms that can detect and indentify species of fish in video data collected onboard fishing vessels. These data help to manage the stock better.  Our goal is to broadly share the tools and methods in this space (computer vision, machine learning and fisheries) in an an attempt to foster innovation and ideally scale the practice of video monitoring in fisheries.

The competition ran from November 14, 2016 to April 12, 2017 and had 2,293 teams participate.

### Video Importer
If you are a fisheries Electronic Monitoring vendor please take a look at our [video importer project](https://github.com/tnc-ca-geo/video-importer). The importer traverses directories to import video as segmented events with correct timestamps and metadata and automates the ingestion of video files so they can be labeled by advanced classifiers running either locally or in the cloud.


### Update 5/26/2017
We are working with winners to package their code using these [criteria](../master/kaggle_to_production.md). If you don't care about all that and just want access to the raw code we have now please submit and issue and we'll provide a download link.
