## Fishface Tuna
Outputs from [Kaggle tuna fisheries competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/the-nature-conservancy-fisheries-monitoring) sponsored by The Nature Conservancy and Vulcan Technologies.  The goal of the competition was to create algorithms that can detect and indentify species of fish in video data collected onboard many fishing vessels.
